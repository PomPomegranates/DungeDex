            Hey Dungeon Masters! Are your players ready to become Dungémon Masters? Your veteran players are probably expecting Oozes, Owlbears, and Orcs, but are they expecting Omastar?
            Make bespoke 5e compatible monsters out of any Pokémon! Save them to your account and edit them to your liking.
            Search for a Pokémon or hit "Randomise" now to get started. Select Browse Dungémon to see what the community has already created!
