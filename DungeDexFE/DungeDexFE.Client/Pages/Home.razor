            Hey Dungeon Masters! Are your players ready to become Dungémon Masters? Your veteran players are probably expecting Oozes, Owlbears, and Orcs, but are they expecting Omastar?

            Search for a Pokémon or hit "Randomise" now to get started. Select Browse Dungémon to see what the community has already created!
        </p>
        <p> Use to either search for the pokemon you want or to select a random pokemon</p>
        <p>If the pokemon has forms please write the specific form after a hyphen (eg giratina-origin)</p>
